# Clean Code Policy

- Let the code speak for itself. Do not describe what is already obvious from the code.
- Before implementing new features or changes, analyze the existing code to understand if something can be extended or reused.
- No functional duplication
- Keep code history intact; avoid copying files unnecessarily breaking git history.
- Maintains established directory structure
2- Professional IT admin approach: consolidate, don't proliferate
